# Project Title
A brief look at various code I've written, demonstrating various techniques in astrophysics research. 

## Description
This repository contains code from several academic/extracurricular pursuits related to astrophysics. Projects here include: modeling the trajectory of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy, estimating the Hubble Constant using Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs), and more. NOTE: computational astrophysics code will be added to repository in 1-2 months after I am granted permission to include it publicly.
